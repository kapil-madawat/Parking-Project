******************* Project Parking Lot *****************************************

Java version used for this project is java 8

//assumptions made by me

1. The maxium floor for parking Lot is 20. If user Enter more than 20 floor, application will not create parking lot.

2. As given in requirment for VIP pepole we have to reserve some slot in parking lot.
So max slot for vip pepole is 5 which is reserved and regular pepole will not get that slot.

3.The Vechile registration no For VIP pepole start from KA05-A1 to KA05-A10.

4.As given in requirment For repeated customer, we should give some discount.So if any repeated customer will come application will give 30rs discount.

5.To check repeated customer repeated customer Vechile registration no start from KA06-A1 to KA06-A4.

6.Each floor will create 20 slot for parking.

7.In one slot you can keep 2 cars or 5 bikes at a time.

8.By default slot is allocated for CAR Parking. The slot is automatically converted into bike parking if Bike comes. 

9.For Parking lower floor slot will be assigned first and than higher floors.

10.The slot allocation is on first come first serve basis, so whichever vehicle  come first get the paking near the entrance and at lower floor.

11.Regular person cannot get the VIP slots. So if there are no VIP vehicle than the VIP slots remain empty.
