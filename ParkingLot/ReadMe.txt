******************* Project  Parking Lot *****************************************

Java version used for this project is java 8

//assumptions made by me

1. The maxium floor for parking Lot is 20. If user Enter more than 20 floor, application will not create parking lot.

2. As given in requirment for VIP pepole we have to reserved some slot in parking lot.
So max slot for vip pepole is 5 which is reserved and regular pepole will not get that slot.

3.The Vechile registration no For VIP pepole start from KA05-A1 to KA05-A10.

4.As given in requirment For repeated customer, we should give some discount.So if any repeated customer will come application will give 30rs discount.

5.To check repeated customer repeated customer Vechile registration no start from KA06-A1 to KA06-A3.

6.Each floor will create 20 slot for parking.

7.In one slot you can keep 2 cars or 5 bikes at a time.

8.By default slot is allocated for CAR Parking. The slot is automatically converte in bike parking if Bike  will come. 

9.For Parking that lower floor slot assign first and than higher floor.

10.The slot allocation is first come first serve, so who will come first get the paking near the entrance and lower floor.

11.Regular person cannot get the VIP slots so it can either be empty if VIP is not available.
